title: "cuOT: Accelerating Oblivious Transfer on GPUs for Privacy-preserving Computation"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2025-05-cuot
excerpt: 'This paper proposes \sys, a novel framework for accelerating OT on 
        the GPU based on a CUDA implementation. \sys implements OT variants 
        based on recent silent OT extension constructions which significantly 
        reduce communication at the cost of higher computation.'
