As an emerging researcher working towards a PhD, my interdisciplinary research focus involves using high performance computation such as GPUs to accelerate cryptograhic protocols, particularly those used in secure multi-party computation (MPC). My work is integrated into machine learning applications. My motivation for choosing this field comes from an interest in bringing abstract algebra into hardware implementation and the bridging the machine learning community and the cryptography community.

Under the guidance of Prof. Zahra Ghodsi, I have published a paper to HOST 2025, a conference by IEEE, proposing a system for accelerated secure computation of non-linear components of a neural network using Oblivious Transfer as a building block, with future work in the pipeline pending submission to other conferences.

I am currently looking for a research internship at any time, preferably during the summer. In my earlier days, I completed my undergraduate studies at Taylor's University (Malaysia), and Purdue University.
